Chapter 2, Exercise 1, Problem 6

Which method runs faster for an array with all keys identical, selection sort or insertion sort?

- I think that this would be similar to when the array is already sorted, 
so that insertion sort will be linear, and the selection sort quadratic.

Chapter 2, Exercise 1, Problem 7

Which method runs faster for an array in reverse order, selection sort or insertion sort?

- I think that they would run similarly, since the values at every position will have to be changed. 
The worst case scenario for insertion sort is reverse order, so that would mean it is quadratic, 
and then the selection sort would already be quadratic as well.
